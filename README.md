Admin Scripts acts as a wrapper for small admin scripts that don't warrant a full-blown add-on. It was designed with two use-cases in mind:

1. General-purpose utility scripts.
2. Utility scripts related to (and bundled with) a specific add-on. For example, an add-on may wish to provide an admin script that populates the database with dummy content for demonstration purposes, and another script to "reset" the add-on, by emptying its database tables.

Admin Scripts is pretty rough-and-ready at the moment. It was written quickly, to meet a specific demand. If you're not comfortable digging through the source code to figure out how everything works, this probably isn't the add-on for you.
